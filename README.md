# Facebook on the Terminal

This project was a command line tool for navigating Facebook Messenger on the terminal. It was actively maintained from Jan 6, 2019 until the end of 2021.

This original adaptation is from [Alex Rose's fb-messenger-cli](https://github.com/Alex-Rose/fb-messenger-cli). I am grateful to him and the open-source community for giving me the freedom to customize this project in making Facebook Messenger what it should have always been -- an Internet Relay Chat with a large base of active users.

Suffice to say, this tool made online communication clean, productive, and non-addictive. As we build communication tools for the future, we should work towards this ideal.

These days, I use Signal Messenger as my de facto app of communication. In the meantime, I will leave this repo open for the open-source community. 

All that is gold does not glitter, Not all those who wander are lost.
