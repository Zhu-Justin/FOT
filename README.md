# Facebook on the Terminal

## Motivation
I was going through my screen time one day and noticed how much time I was spending on Facebook.  

I turned off my News Feed and started to deactivate my Facebook account.  One thing kept me coming back -- Facebook Messenger.  

How, then, to best communicate with friends?  

Enter Facebook on the Terminal.
